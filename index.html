	<h1>Hi I am Isa Hridoy</h1>
	<p> I am 23 years old. I live in New York, United States of America with my parents and younger brother. I am a student in City University of New York. My major is Computer Science. Because I not only love programming but also am very ambitious and it can only be achieved through this field of technology. I am doing this course because I want to be a full-stack web developer. Though I have my doubts o either to be a web developer or a data-scientist, I believe this course will provide answers for me also I want to have a secured income for upcoming economy of the world after the pandemic as I am not guaranteed to receive a job right after my graduation next year in sha Allah. Moreover, tcompanies only hire people with experience. Though I have done projects and am in a research with my professor in data-science field, so far I have no experience in full-stack except for academics but with a strong fiverr or upwork resume I am ahead compared to other bachelor degree holders in the same field. My hobby is cooking, doing music etc. I play games, watch anime or series in my leisure. </p>
